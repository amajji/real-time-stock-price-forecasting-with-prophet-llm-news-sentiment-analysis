- This project combines both real-time and historical stock price data with news sentiment analysis to provide more accurate price forecasts and analyze market trends. The sentiment analysis is performed using models like DistilBERT or a quantized version of LLaMA with 1 billion paramters, which analyze stock related news and generate sentiment scores. These sentiment scores are then integrated into one of the price forecasting models such as ARIMA, LSTM, and Prophet.

- By incorporating sentiment analysis as an additional feature, the models can take into account external factors (news sentiment) that may influence stock's future price movements. 

- The user can select : 
    - News sentiment analysis model: DistilBert or a quantized version of LLaMA with 1B paramters.
    - Price forcasting model such as ARIMA, LSTM or PROPHET.

The data for both historical and real time prices is fetched using the YFinance and NewsApi API.
